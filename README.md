# Dashtoon:
The submission for the dashtoon assignment. The model takes input as images from the web I have used the images as follows, Style image as 'Starry Night' by Van Gogh and the Base image for content is a Urban image.
You can just make an ipynb file then copy the ipynb above and run it directly given you have installed the TensorFlow, Numpy and Matplotlib Library.
